# trivia_quizApp

Recently, I finished a Udemy course on the subject of JavaScript published by Jonas Schmedtmann, 
so I decided to do some practice and came up with this project. 📌

My goal was to structure the project using the MVC architectural pattern 
with the Publisher-Subscriber solution 
and to fetch data from a publicly available API, 
so I used https://the-trivia-api.com

I tried to structure the HTML by BEM naming convention, but boy, oh boy... 
I should better take it seriously next time. 
For styling, I just separated some scss files for better organization.

My keyboard is still alive and my goal looks like it's completed! ✅

Please, take a look!
I'm ready for feedback. 

The quiz is actually fun! 😁 For 10 minutes! 😁😁
